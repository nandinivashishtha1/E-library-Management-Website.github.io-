                <p>E Library Management System is a system which maintains the information
                    about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to
                    whom books are issued and all. This is very difficult to organize
                    manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task.
                    Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an E Library
                    becomes much simple. The E Library Management has been designed to
                    computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the
                    members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of
                    library helps in many instances of its maintenances.</p>
